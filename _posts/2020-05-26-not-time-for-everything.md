Hello I've got thousands of projects in my mind.

But not enought time to develop them.

Some beautiful ideas:
- ESP controller for hydroponics system.
- Modbus/RS485 garden automation
- EOL resistor in sensor AKA anti tampering lines
- a presentation of my NFT like garden
- Class AB amplified boombox for my pc
